Category: Tools
Tags: website, pelican, python
Slug: pelican-workflow
Summary: My workflow for using Pelican to generate static websites, and publishing to GitHub.

# Preparation
1. Crate a virtual environment for Pelican via `virtualenv` before installing Pelican
2. Once the virtual environment has been created and activated, Pelican can be be installed via `pip install pelican`
3. Install additional dependencies: `pip install Markdown typogrify`
4. Once Pelican has been installed, you can create a source project via the `pelican-quickstart`
5. Prepare two GitHub repositories, one for source project (origin) and one for user pages (userpage)
6. Add the source project to the origin repository
7. Use ghp-import (installed via `pip install ghp-import`) to push the content of the output dir generated by Pelican to the `gh-pages` branch
8. Push the source project's `gh-pages` branch to the `master` branch of <username>.github.com repository on GitHub.

# Writing/Publishing
1. Pull the source project from origin
2. Activate the virtual environment for Pelican 
3. Start the local web server and monitor content changes via `make devserver`
4. Add/write content under `content` dir
5. Once done testing changes, stop the development server via `./develop_server.sh stop`
6. Publish the changes to user pages via `make github`
7. Push the changes to source project
